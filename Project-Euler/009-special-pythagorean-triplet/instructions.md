[Problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)<br>
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

```
3(2) + 4(2) = 5(2)
9    + 16   = 25
a2   + b2   = c2
```

For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
